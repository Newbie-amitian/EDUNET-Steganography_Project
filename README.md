# EDUNET-Steganography_Project

This project is a Steganography-based encryption tool that allows users to securely hide secret messages within images. It enhances security by implementing multiple encryption techniques and a user-friendly GUI for seamless operation.

## Features

- Encrypt and hide secret messages inside images.
- Supports multiple encryption methods: XOR, AES, ChaCha20, and AES+ECC.
- Decrypt and extract hidden messages securely.
- Password-based and key-based encryption options.
- Simple and interactive GUI built with PyQt.
- Save encrypted images for later retrieval.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Newbie-amitian/EDUNET-Steganography_Project.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the system:
    ```bash
    python encryption.py
    ```

## Usage
- Run `encryption.py` to start the application.
- Select an image and enter a secret message.
- Choose an encryption method and provide a password or key.
- Save the encrypted image.
- Run `decryption.py` to extract hidden messages by providing the correct password or key.

## Files Overview
- `encryption.py`: Handles the encryption process and GUI.
- `decryption.py`: Manages the decryption and extraction of hidden messages.
